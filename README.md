# Publication-Quality-Bar-Graphs
Reporting pre- and post-test scores is very common in intervention-based social scientific research. Often times, these visualizations appear in research papers but are plotted shabbily or incorrectly. The following repository contains a Jupyter notebook with publication-quality visualization of pre- and post-test scores of a sample psychological intervention using _matplotlib_ in Python. 

**Visualization**: Mean scores on various psychological constructs such as self-awareness, emotional suppression, cognitive reappraisal, etc., along with their standard deviations for a sample of teachers and students (note: each score is stored in a separate column in the imported CSV file).

**Pros**: Serif fonts, soothing color schemes and usage of patterns to distinguish pre-post results.
